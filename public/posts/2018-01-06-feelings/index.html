    <p>Feelings are fleeting by nature, like the passage of clouds on a warm summer day.</p>

<p>Though too often we wear them like immutable masks and declare, &ldquo;This is me. This is all I will ever be.&rdquo; Sad. Resentful. Despondent. Happy. In truth they are masks, transient facades that hide a more true and vulnerable sense of self.</p>

<p>We put these masks on when we&rsquo;re scared, when we&rsquo;re too afraid to ask for attention and love; when we&rsquo;re on the verge of breaking, but don&rsquo;t know how to ask for help. When we&rsquo;re searching for something solid in the face of groundlessness. Even happiness is something we try too hard to hold onto, strangling it of all significance in the process.</p>

<p>Feelings are signals: they point toward ourselves, toward the unknown. But they are not us.</p>

<p>To take this non-attached perspective is more terrifying than the feelings themselves; we would rather feel angry and sad than to risk being a drop in the ocean (Yet, what is an ocean but a multitude of drops?). Non-attachment is not detachment. Detaching is active avoidance whereas non-attachment is active engagement––detachment runs while non-attachment sits and feels and notices with non-judgment.</p>

<p>From the vantage of non-attachment, we can see our feelings as they truly are: simply feelings, waves that come and go like the seasons; things as permanent as the illusory grounds they stand upon.</p>

<p>Then who are we if not our feelings? What is under the mask? What is left?</p>

<p>We are something else, something both more and less grounded, a shifting paradox, something wildly, unconditionally beautiful.</p>

<p>We are the calm after a storm.</p>

<p>A newborn&rsquo;s first breath.</p>

<p>Tiny motes of existence.</p>

<p>A beam piercing through the darkness.</p>

<p>The light of Being.</p>

<p>Proof of grace.</p>

<p>Lucky.</p>

<p>Free.</p>
