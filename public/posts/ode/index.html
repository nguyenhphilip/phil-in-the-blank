The manifestation of my demons.

    <p>Each and every day I wake and walk with the sun.<br>
It starts low, climbing over hillsides, rising slowly.<br>
It finds its temporary place amid the sky<br>
and begins to color the Meseta.</p>

<p>Front and center a shadow grows.<br>
It looks at me with indifference – a mirror of my darker side.<br>
Fear, insecurity, doubt,<br>
The manifestation of my demons.</p>

<p>Each and every day, I wake and walk to confront these demons.<br>
If I fight and struggle, I hurt and suffer.<br>
If I push them away, I push myself away.<br>
I cannot hide, I cannot run,<br>
I can only bear witness.</p>

<p>Salvation lies within absence. <br>
Dare I do it, dare I eclipse the sun?<br>
No. To turn from the sun is to turn from the truth.<br>
I would be swallowed whole.</p>

<p>My shadow is here,<br>
my shadow is me.<br>
As long as I walk the Way,<br>
it will keep me company.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t be scared<br>
I must not close my eyes<br>
I must continue on<br>
Moving toward the rising dawn.</p>

<p>Each and every day, I wake and walk towards Santiago.<br>
The closer I get, the lighter I feel.<br>
The sun hangs low, peering over hillsides, descending slowly.<br>
Color fades from the Meseta, and my shadow is behind me.</p>

<p>Westward lies Santiago. I look.<br>
The sun has set, the dark has settled.<br>
A fire is growing deep inside.<br>
It lights the valley and shows me the Way.<br>
I wake and walk toward the Light,<br>
Closer and closer to Santiago.</p>
