Dance with melancholy And sing out your blues but please Don&rsquo;t stop.
Talk to me. Tell me about it. Whatever you feel, feel it."/>

    <p>Dear stranger, <br>
I know we’ve just met but, <br>
I love you.</p>

<p>I love you more than you could know. <br>
I love you unconditionally. <br>
I love you.</p>

<p>I cannot know your pain, your experience, <br>
Your suffering. That is all yours. <br>
But you do not have to bear it <br>
alone.</p>

<p>Dance with melancholy <br>
And sing out your blues but please <br>
Don&rsquo;t stop.</p>

<p>Talk to me. Tell me about it. <br>
Whatever you feel, feel it. <br>
Then do one thing for yourself–– <br>
One act of self-love.</p>

<p>It won&rsquo;t always feel good <br>
Like going to the gym <br>
Or eating your vegetables <br>
Or calling your mother <br>
Or crying–– <br>
Crying helps.</p>

<p>But know this:<br>
Admitting weakness is not weak.<br>
It is simply the beginning
of something new.</p>

<p>So tear up and throw out <br>
Those old pictures of your lover <br>
Into your favorite trash bin. <br></p>

<p>Forgive them and forgive yourself. <br>
And when you’re done you can begin <br>
Loving again. <br>
Loving yourself. <br>
Loving life. <br></p>

<p>We may feel <br>
just an ounce more ready <br>
to engage in a world <br>
filled with facts and problems,
awe and inspiration,
rosebuds and thorns,
heartbreak and love. <br></p>

<p>We may feel <br>
just an ounce more ready <br>
to let ourselves <br>
be hurt again.</p>
