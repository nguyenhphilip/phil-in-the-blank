      September 28, 2017 - Day 22 To be yourself–
Easy to say, hard to do.
What we think is not ours.
What we believe is shaped by others.
The only thing we own is
what we feel.
Our inner compass, the way we connect with
The outer world; only we can see and touch and
Feel the way we do. Never lose it.
Never let it go.

Met Enrico and Sia today.

      Day 21 4:30am. I inch out from my sleeping bag like a slug, careful not to disturb the others in the room, pack my things and head downstairs. Pauline and Morgan are already awake. We’re late.
My eyes are crusty. I wolf down a prepacked sandwich – chorizo and cheese – with yogurt. Pauline makes us some coffee. Bland, but it will do. Shoes on, rucksacks shouldered, we’re on the move.

      September 23, 2017 - Day 17 We are always on the cusp of collapse and redemption. Do we choose to rise, or do we settle and fall?
Stories = meaning. The mind is a meaning-making machine.
Stories have the power to change people’s lives, and we are the narrators.

Today, a group of Americans invited me to their table at dinner. They were much older than me and asked a lot of questions.

      Each and every day I wake and walk with the sun.
It starts low, climbing over hillsides, rising slowly.
It finds its temporary place amid the sky
and begins to color the Meseta.
Front and center a shadow grows.
It looks at me with indifference – a mirror of my darker side.
Fear, insecurity, doubt,
The manifestation of my inner demons.
Each and every day, I wake and walk and confront them.

      I&rsquo;ve sunken into the depths of an all-too-familiar melancholy.
She is gone. I am alone. My emotions swing to the erratic cadence of an unforgiving metronome.
 I’m fine. Tick. I’m fine. Tick. I’m not. Tick. 
I miss the jade of her eyes, those luminescent opals I so often lose myself in. The ease of her smile, always able to bring about my own. The way she plucked those juicy blackberries from their thorny brambles, always a tad out of reach, the hem of her shirt lifting ever so slightly in the process, revealing the contours of a titillating landscape I secretly wished to explore.

      Day 15. We’re sitting amid a small cluster of dining tables in the main plaza of Burgos, sipping on wine and eating tapas. The patrons and pilgrims look happy, the cathedral towers above us. I look up and wonder, is there such a thing as a good goodbye?
Marieke looks content and tells her squirrel joke again. I try to listen, but my attention has been seized by the fact that she is leaving tonight.

      “Phil! I have a genius idea. You’re really going to like it.”
It&rsquo;s the 12th day. Marieke, Stepan and I go to the top of a hill to catch the sunset. We sift through an amber field of grass and wheat and settle ourselves in a small circular clearing. The sky is cloudless, a cool breeze is present.
We talk for awhile, about what I cant&rsquo;t remember, but I feel wonderfully content.

      In the morning we walk to Pamplona, our first city. I run into Maria and chat with her for a brief moment before running off with the girls to get breakfast. I didn’t know it then, but that would be my final conversation with her. One thing the Camino teaches you, by nature of necessity, is how to let go. People, places, your past. The present demands it be so.

      Another gray and rainy day. We sleep in and start walking at 8am. After the deep and enlightening conversations of yesterday, we decide to walk in solitude –– together, but left to the vicinity of our inner worlds.
My feelings throughout the morning are in contrast with the highs of the previous; I was in a blue, melancholic state of mind. Thoughts of the future, about something out of reach.

      Through the window I see Sun-bathed flowers and untouched rock,
Blades of grass and untrodden walks,
Endless possibility.
I ask of you Time
To yield your determined hand
So I may dance
Forever with Infinity.
 I run into Matilde and Franca while departing from Roncesvalles. They&rsquo;re headed in the opposite direction, back toward the albergue, when they call out to me.
“Phiiiiilll! Heeeey we’re gonna make some tea! Would you like to join us?
