      I&rsquo;ve sunken into the depths of an all-too-familiar melancholy.
She is gone. I am alone. My emotions swing to the erratic cadence of an unforgiving metronome.
 I’m fine. Tick. I’m fine. Tick. I’m not. Tick. 
I miss the jade of her eyes, those luminescent opals I so often lose myself in. The ease of her smile, always able to bring about my own. The way she plucked those juicy blackberries from their thorny brambles, always a tad out of reach, the hem of her shirt lifting ever so slightly in the process, revealing the contours of a titillating landscape I secretly wished to explore.

      Day 15. We’re sitting amid a small cluster of dining tables in the main plaza of Burgos, sipping on wine and eating tapas. The patrons and pilgrims look happy, the cathedral towers above us. I look up and wonder, is there such a thing as a good goodbye?
Marieke looks content and tells her squirrel joke again. I try to listen, but my attention has been seized by the fact that she is leaving tonight.

      “Phil! I have a genius idea. You’re really going to like it.”
It&rsquo;s the 12th day. Marieke, Stepan and I go to the top of a hill to catch the sunset. We sift through an amber field of grass and wheat and settle ourselves in a small circular clearing. The sky is cloudless, a cool breeze is present.
We talk for awhile, about what I cant&rsquo;t remember, but I feel wonderfully content.

      In the morning we walk to Pamplona, our first city. I run into Maria and chat with her for a brief moment before running off with the girls to get breakfast. I didn’t know it then, but that would be my final conversation with her. One thing the Camino teaches you, by nature of necessity, is how to let go. People, places, your past. The present demands it be so.

      Another gray and rainy day. We sleep in and start walking at 8am. After the deep and enlightening conversations of yesterday, we decide to walk in solitude –– together, but left to the vicinity of our inner worlds.
My feelings throughout the morning are in contrast with the highs of the previous; I was in a blue, melancholic state of mind. Thoughts of the future, about something out of reach.

      Through the window I see Sun-bathed flowers and untouched rock,
Blades of grass and untrodden walks,
Endless possibility.
I ask of you Time
To yield your determined hand
So I may dance
Forever with Infinity.
 I run into Matilde and Franca while departing from Roncesvalles. They&rsquo;re headed in the opposite direction, back toward the albergue, when they call out to me.
“Phiiiiilll! Heeeey we’re gonna make some tea! Would you like to join us?

      I woke to the sound of creaking bunk beds, rustling backpacks, and hushed chatter. 5:30 a.m. Time to go. I put my boots on, packed my sleeping bag, and went downstairs.
Small talk of good weather and stellar walking conditions and free bread as stiff as stones. I devour as much of it as my mouth can muster and head out.
The first day was supposed to be arduous: 27 kilometers from Saint-Jean to Roncesvalles, with a gradual gain of 1400 meters in elevation.

      The Camino de Santiago is a network of pilgrimage routes that ultimately converge on the city of Santiago de Compostela in Northwestern Spain, where the great Saint James is rumored to be buried.
The most popular route is the Camino Frances. It begins at Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port in Southern France, a small city located north of the Pyrenees, and totals about 500 miles across Spain to the city of Santiago de Compostela. Many walk the Camino for spiritual and religious reasons; I walked in search of myself.

      In May of 2017, while working in a Title I Elementary school in New Hampshire, I read a little fable called “Rebirth” by Kaval Ravikant.
The main character, Amit, is unable to return home after the death of his estranged father. He wanders, lost and filled with pain and grief, and is led to the Camino de Santiago. There he meets many travelers and pilgrims. Some are lost and searching for answers, others are running from their past, but all have a story to share.
