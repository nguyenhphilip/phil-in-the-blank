Arbiter of cessation, master of endings, <br>
a gust inevitably endured. <br>
Clench your jaw now, the exchange is complete: <br>
Snow and frost for people and sidewalks. <br>
Inches and burdens <br>
for sauntered footfalls.

There is a season between seasons <br>
a bridge that is crossed by the plentiful few. <br>
Adults and scientists seek it endlessly <br>
though only the children know <br>
of its whereabouts. <br>
But don’t bother with asking–– <br>
they’re sworn to the promises of secrecy.

I make no guarantees of my own: <br>
Certainty is certainly <br>
out of the picture. <br>
Though some day you may catch hint of <br>
what it is and <br>
where it may be found.

A clue: <br>
It's right in front of you. <br>
Between one breath of Winter and <br>
One sigh of Spring <br>
There exists everything <br>
essential.
