Day 15. We’re sitting amid a small cluster of dining tables in the main plaza of Burgos, sipping on wine and eating tapas. The patrons and pilgrims look happy, the cathedral towers above us. I look up and wonder, is there such a thing as a good goodbye?

Marieke looks content and tells her squirrel joke again. I try to listen, but my attention has been seized by the fact that she is leaving tonight. I take a sip of wine, and we continue talking. Stepan – a pilgrim from Czech we had met some days ago – is with us. He reminds me of a winter wolf. His hair is white like snow with hints of dark gray. He’s observant and quiet. Does Marieke notice the way he looks at her? Or how I do too?

<br>

Stepan and I book a hostel. We want to have one night away from the congested albergues of the Camino. We drop our things off and go to dinner at our favorite restaurant -- the one with the Falafel -- with Marieke. 

Stepan goes to the bathroom, and I give M the bus note I had written for her in the morning. We replay every scene and memory of days passed. She rests her head on my shoulder and we sit in silence, wishing for the coming of tomorrow to cease its advance.

Suddenly Marieke sees our tall Texan friend, Stefan, walking across the middle of the plaza. And at his sides were Matilde and Franca! 

We sprint toward the lovable Germans, screaming their names in unison. I hurl myself onto Franca and give her the biggest hug of my life, nearly knocking over an elderly couple in the process. Their timing could be no more perfect.

<br>

9pm. We’re in the bus station. Marieke is leaving soon. I have her listen to “Soul Meets Body” by Death Cab for Cutie. Stepan is standing a few meters away from us, searching for the bus, as if he were the one leaving. Maybe he’s giving Marieke and I some space. Earlier, he had said that he didn't do goodbyes well. Does anyone?

The bus arrives. Marieke and I embrace. Time bends.

To our sentimental whims. To our refusal to let go the present.

It bends because we have not accepted a future in which we will be nothing more than a memory, a firing of indifferent, constantly reforming neurons.

It bends because we are fighting for the ineffable, for something so palpably insatiable, for what I have felt for the first time in my life: love.

It bends because we will not.

The bus parks. People are hailed over. We let go. She boards. I look at her one last time. She looks back. The hint of a smile creeps over her like a foreign facade.

The engine comes to life, and the bus is wheeled into the dim tunnel.

Time reclaims its throne.

She's gone.

<br>

By some convergence of chance and choice, Marieke and I met and walked together on the Camino for two weeks. Those weeks were some of the best in my life. Her energy and zest were unmatchable. Every blackberry she ate, every sip of coffee she had, every conversation we held was something to be cherished. She taught me that only by giving oneself up to life could it be fully lived.

“If you’re sad, feel sad. Happy, feel happy. Whatever it is, don’t push it away."

"Having emotions just means you’re alive!”

To her life was a privilege, not a birthright, and she embraced it with every ounce of her being.

One week in, she told me I had become her best friend. Now, I won’t lie: when she said that, I started imagining all kinds of romantic fantasies and happy endings between us.

“Hey children, your ol’ Gramps met this lovely lady 35 years ago while walking across Spain! It was destiny!”

“Yeah, cool story bro, but I met my love on the Camino.”

To her, my insecurities, fears, and struggles were valid parts of me, yet in comparison to my strengths as a human, they were wholly insignificant. She awed at and encouraged my child-like curiosity, the way I saw the world, and the purity of being she believed me to possess. “You have something special to give to the world.” She was relentless in her attempts of making me believe in myself. I did. I do.

When she left, I didn’t feel sad -- in fact, oddly, I felt happy. Not because she was gone, but because we had both grown. Because she had found what she was searching for. And because I was able to let go of my Camino soulmate, or so I believed.
