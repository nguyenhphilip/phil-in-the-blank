Dear stranger, <br>
I know we’ve just met but, <br>
I love you. 

I love you more than you could know. <br>
I love you unconditionally. <br>
I love you. 

I cannot know your pain, your experience, <br>
Your suffering. That is all yours. <br>
But you do not have to bear it <br>
alone. 

Dance with melancholy <br>
And sing out your blues but please <br>
Don't stop. 

Talk to me. Tell me about it. <br>
Whatever you feel, feel it. <br>
Then do one thing for yourself–– <br>
One act of self-love. 

It won't always feel good <br>
Like going to the gym <br>
Or eating your vegetables <br>
Or calling your mother <br>
Or crying–– <br>
Crying helps. 

But know this:<br>
Admitting weakness is not weak.<br>
It is simply the beginning
of something new.

So tear up and throw out <br>
Those old pictures of your lover <br>
Into your favorite trash bin. <br>

Forgive them and forgive yourself. <br>
And when you’re done you can begin <br>
Loving again. <br>
Loving yourself. <br>
Loving life. <br>

We may feel <br>
just an ounce more ready <br>
to engage in a world <br>
filled with facts and problems,
awe and inspiration, 
rosebuds and thorns,
heartbreak and love. <br>

We may feel <br>
just an ounce more ready <br>
to let ourselves <br>
be hurt again.
